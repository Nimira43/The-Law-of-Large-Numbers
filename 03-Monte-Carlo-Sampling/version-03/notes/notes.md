## Version 3 Notes

#### Population and Sampling Parameters:

###### Sets up the population size, sample size, and number of samples.

#### Generate Population:

###### Creates a large population of numbers using a log space and takes their inverse.

#### True Mean:

###### Calculates the true mean of the generated population.

#### Output Population Details:

###### Prints the details of the population and sampling parameters.

#### Random Sampling:

###### Draws a random sample and prints the sample as well as the mean of another sample.

#### Sample Means Calculation:

###### Draws multiple samples, calculates the mean of each sample, and stores these means in an array.
###### Print Statements: Added inline print statements to document the mean of each sample as it is calculated.

#### Plotting:

###### Plots the sample means using a scatter plot.
###### Outputs the overall mean and standard deviation of the sample means.

## Outcome

#### Population Analysis: 
###### Generated a large dataset and calculated its true mean.

#### Sampling Analysis: 
###### Performed random sampling and computed the means of multiple samples.

#### Visualisation: 
###### Plotted the distribution of sample means, providing a clear graphical representation of your data.
