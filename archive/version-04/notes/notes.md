## Code Breakdown:
#### Import Libraries:

```
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import numpy as np
```

#### Initialise Population Size:

```
population_size = 2.3e5
print('Population Size: ', population_size)
```

###### Initialises and prints the population size (230,000).


#### Generate Population of Numbers:

```
population = 1 / np.logspace(np.log10(0.001), np.log10(10), int(population_size))
print('Population of Numbers: ', population)
```

###### Generates an array of numbers spaced evenly on a logarithmic scale between 10^-3 and 10.

###### Takes the inverse of these numbers.

###### Prints the generated population of numbers.

#### Plot the Inverse Values with Skipping:

```
skip = int(1e3)
plt.plot(population[::skip], 'o')
plt.show()
```

###### Defines a skip variable to reduce the number of points plotted for better visualisation.

###### Uses plt.plot to create a scatter plot ('o') of the inverse frequency values, plotting every 1000th value in the population array.

###### Displays the plot using plt.show().

#### Expected Output:
###### When you run this code, you will see a scatter plot showing the inverse of the logarithmically spaced values, with points spaced out to maintain clarity and readability.

###### This approach ensures that even with a large dataset, the plot remains clean and easy to interpret.
