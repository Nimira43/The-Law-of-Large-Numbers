## Sierpinski Circle 

###### A Sierpinski Circle (a fractal structure similar to the Sierpinski Triangle) using the Monte Carlo method. This involves recursively removing smaller circles from within a larger circle.

#### Hereâ€™s how to approach it:

###### Start with a large circle.

###### Randomly generate points inside the circle.

###### Use a recursive algorithm to determine if a point is within one of the smaller removed circles (gaps) and plot it accordingly.
